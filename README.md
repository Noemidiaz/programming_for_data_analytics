## About this repository:


This repository contains a portion of my work , assigments and project for Programming for data analytics module at ATU.

### assignments folder:

In this folder there are the following Jupyter Notebook for each task:

- **assignment2-weather**:

This task involves the creation of a Jupyter notebook to visualize the temperature data from a CSV file, and to make a well-designed plot of the "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius" over time.

The skills developed include using Pandas to manage data and create visually appealing plots.

- **assignment3-pie**:

The aim in this assignment is to create a Jupyter notebook to generate a pie chart showing the distribution of email domains from a CSV file containing data on 1000 people.

It helps develop skills in data handling, specifically extracting and processing email domain data, and creating clear pie charts which helps to visualize categorical data.

- **assignmet5-risk** :

The goal of this task is to create a program that simulates and visualizes battle outcomes in the board game Risk, following its rules and plots the results.

This task trains key skills in programming and data analytics, including simulation development, data processing, and statistical analysis. It also develops data visualization, computational thinking, and problem-solving, all of which are essential for modeling real-world scenarios and communicating insights effectively in analytics.

- **assignment6-weather**: 

The aim of this assignment is to create a Python program to analyze and visualize weather data from Knock Airport (Ireland), including temperature and windspeed trends, dealing with missing data and working out with some statistical measures.

Between the skills trained in this task are data manipulation, statistical analysis, handling missing data, and creating clear and insightful visualizations.


### project folder: 

This project analyzes wind data at Dublin Airport from January 2000 to December 2024. The data used in this project was collected from from [Met Ã‰ireann](https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data).

#### Aims of project

The main goals of the project are:

- Analyze wind direction trends by year and month to identify patterns.
- Assess the impact of wind patterns on airport operations.
- Generate data that could inform future wind farm installations by understanding regional wind behavior.

#### Tools used

Several tools were used in this project for data analysis and visualization:

- Pandas: Python library for data manipulation, analysis and visualization (DataFrames, visualizing data...)

- Matplotlib: for plotting including the colormap feature of matplotlib.cm 

- numpy: Python library for handling numerical data and mathematical functions.

- SQLite: organize data by year and month, reformat date and calculare metrics such as average

- Scikit Learn for machine learning tasks: 
        - model selection train_test_split: which helps for Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
        - linear model LinearRegression: which helps to predict trends in the future.

#### Conclusion
aThe project concludes with a summary of key findings on wind trends at Dublin Airport over the past 24 years, including predictions for the next ten years. It also reflects on the importance of this data for both airport operations and potential wind farm investments.
